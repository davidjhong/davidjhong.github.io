                <p>I created a visual equation solver akin to Photomath using Python and OpenCV. The program classifies basic math operators through gray pattern and number extraction. Key frameworks I utilized include OpenCV for image processing, JSON for data storage, OS commands, and Tkinter for the GUI. This project allowed me to gain experience with computer vision techniques like optical character recognition. Overall, it demonstrates my Python skills and ability to develop an end-to-end application from image processing to user interface.</p>

                <p>As the treasurer and web developer for my high school's Science Olympiad team, I honed valuable leadership, technical, and communication abilities. In the treasurer role, I maintained accurate financial records, managed fundraising and sponsorship efforts, and ensured fiscal responsibility. Developing the team website provided hands-on experience with web development using WordPress, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I collaborated closely with our president and other officers to create a user-friendly site that served as an effective resource for members. Through Science Olympiad, I strengthened skills in time management, attention to detail, problem-solving, and working cooperatively in a team environment. Both the web development and treasurer positions required clear communication and the ability to explain complex concepts simply and accurately. My time on the Science Olympiad leadership team sparked my interest in STEM fields and demonstrated the value of perseverance and creativity in tackling challenges.</p>

                <p>I developed a 3 layer home security system using facial recognition and AI through a custom website. The system connects an Arduino board to a password-protected website I built with HTML, CSS, and ReactJS. My C++ code integrates the hardware with the website and Python functions for remote monitoring. Through this project I improved technical skills including programming, web development, and hardware integration, cutting the time required to manage home security by 50%. Overall, this project showcases my ability to create an end-to-end security system with AI and web connectivity.</p>

                <p>I designed and developed this personal portfolio website using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to showcase my projects and abilities. The site incorporates JavaScript for interactive features like modal popups to improve user experience. Following responsive design principles, the site renders seamlessly across varying screen sizes and devices. Through this project I honed skills in web development, responsive design, and adding interactivity with JavaScript. Developing my portfolio site gave me hands-on experience bringing a personal vision to life through code. This demonstrates both my development skills and ability to build an engaging user-focused website.</p>

                <p>I created a website landing page using HTML and CSS with adjustable screen sizes. The responsive design ensures optimal viewing across devices. Interactive buttons and links engage users and facilitate site navigation. Through this project I refined skills in web development, responsive design, and CSS styling. Crafting the landing page provided hands-on experience optimizing user experience. Overall this demonstrates my ability to develop an accessible, user-friendly website interface.</p>
