                <p>Through participating in numerous hackathons, I have gained valuable hands-on experience in coding, collaboration, and communication. The fast-paced and intense nature of hackathons provided opportunities to quickly prototype and develop projects using languages like Python, JavaScript, and C++. Working closely with teammates, often meeting for the first time at the start of the event, honed my ability to effectively collaborate and coordinate with others. Presenting our hacks at the conclusion of the events also improved my public speaking and communication abilities. The creativity and problem-solving skills I leveraged during hackathons allow me to thrive in environments requiring nimble and adaptive thinking. I'm eager to apply the well-rounded expertise I built through hackathons to new challenges and innovation efforts.</p>

                <p>As a member of the Association for Computing Machinery (ACM) chapter at the University of California, Riverside, I have developed valuable skills in leadership, communication, and collaboration. Through my involvement as a Sponsorship Committee member, I gained first-hand experience in relationship-building, fundraising, and event organization. Reaching out to potential corporate sponsors enabled me to improve my written and verbal communication abilities. Coordinating logistics for ACM-hosted programming workshops, hackathons, and tech talks required attention to detail, project management, and the ability to work cohesively with other team members. My time in ACM strengthened my passion for computer science and exposed me to the many applications of technology in business and society. I look forward to continuing my membership in ACM and further developing my technical knowledge and leadership capabilities. The practical experience I have gained through this organization has prepared me well for a career in the tech industry.</p>
